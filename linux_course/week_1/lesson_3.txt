Exploring File and Directory Permissions
===============================================================================

- Understanding File and Directory Permissions
--------------------------------------
    - File and Directory Permissions Overview:
--------------------------------------
        - chmod: The 'chmod' command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. It allows users to modify the access permissions for reading, writing, and executing files.
        - chown: The 'chown' command is used to change the ownership of files and directories. It allows users to transfer ownership of files and directories to other users or groups.
        - Symbolic Representation of Permissions: File and directory permissions can be represented symbolically using a combination of letters and symbols. For example, 'r' represents read permission, 'w' represents write permission, and 'x' represents execute permission.

    - Practice Understanding File and Directory Permissions:
--------------------------------------
        1. Changing Permissions with chmod:
            - Example: 
                - Change the permissions of a file named 'example.txt' to allow the owner to read, write, and execute, the group to read and execute, and others to have no permissions:
                    chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o-rwx example.txt
        2. Changing Ownership with chown:
            - Example:
                - Change the ownership of a file named 'example.txt' to a user named 'user1' and a group named 'group1':
                    chown user1:group1 example.txt
        3. Understanding Symbolic Representation:
            - Example:
                - Interpret the permission representation 'rwxr-xr--':
                    - The first three characters 'rwx' represent read, write, and execute permissions for the owner.
                    - The next three characters 'r-x' represent read and execute permissions for the group.
                    - The last three characters 'r--' represent read-only permissions for others.
        4. Practice applying chmod and chown commands:
            - Exercise: 
                - Create a file named 'test.txt' and change its permissions to allow the owner to read and write, the group to read only, and others to have no permissions. Then, change the ownership of the file to a different user and group.
