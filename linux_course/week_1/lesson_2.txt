Learning File Manipulation
===============================================================================

- Understanding File Manipulation in Debian
--------------------------------------
    - File Manipulation Commands Overview:
--------------------------------------
        - cp: The 'cp' command is used to copy files or directories from one location to another. It creates a duplicate of the specified file or directory.
        - mv: The 'mv' command is used to move files or directories from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files and directories.
        - ln: The 'ln' command is used to create links between files. There are two types of links: hard links and symbolic links. Hard links point directly to the data of the original file, while symbolic links point to the file's location.

    - Practice Copying, Moving, and Linking Files:
--------------------------------------
        1. Copying Files:
            - Example: 
                - Copy a file named 'source.txt' to a directory named 'destination':
                    cp source.txt destination/
        2. Moving Files:
            - Example: 
                - Move a file named 'file.txt' to a directory named 'new_directory':
                    mv file.txt new_directory/
            - Renaming Files:
                - Example: 
                    - Rename a file named 'oldname.txt' to 'newname.txt':
                        mv oldname.txt newname.txt
        3. Creating Symbolic Links:
            - Example: 
                - Create a symbolic link named 'link' pointing to a file named 'target.txt':
                    ln -s /path/to/target.txt link
        4. Creating Hard Links:
            - Example: 
                - Create a hard link named 'hard_link' pointing to a file named 'source.txt':
                    ln /path/to/source.txt hard_link
        5. Practice using these commands:
            - Exercise: 
                - Create a file named 'original.txt', then copy it to a new file named 'duplicate.txt'. Move the 'duplicate.txt' file to a directory named 'backup'. Finally, create a symbolic link named 'link_to_duplicate' pointing to the 'duplicate.txt' file.
