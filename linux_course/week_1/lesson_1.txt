--------------------------------------
    - Practice Navigating the File System:
--------------------------------------
        1. Open a Terminal: Launch a terminal window on your Debian system.
        2. List Directory Contents with 'ls':
            - Example: 
                - Type 'ls' and press Enter to view the contents of the current directory.
        3. Change Directories with 'cd':
            - Example: 
                - Use 'cd' followed by the directory name to navigate to a different directory. For example, 'cd Documents' to enter the Documents directory.
        4. Print Current Working Directory with 'pwd':
            - Example: 
                - Type 'pwd' and press Enter to display the full path of the current directory.
        5. Create a New Directory with 'mkdir':
            - Example: 
                - Use 'mkdir' followed by the directory name to create a new directory. For example, 'mkdir Projects' to create a Projects directory.
        6. Create an Empty File with 'touch':
            - Example: 
                - Use 'touch' followed by the file name to create a new empty file. For example, 'touch example.txt' to create a file named example.txt.
        7. Remove a File or Directory with 'rm' and 'rmdir':
            - Example: 
                - Use 'rm' followed by the file name to remove a file. For example, 'rm example.txt' to delete the file.
                - Use 'rmdir' followed by the directory name to remove an empty directory. For example, 'rmdir Projects' to delete the Projects directory.
        8. Practice Basic Commands:
            - Exercise: 
                - Navigate to different directories, create new directories and files, and delete them using the commands learned to get comfortable with basic command-line navigation and operations.
