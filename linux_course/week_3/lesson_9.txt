    - Practice Tasks:
-------------------------------------------
        1. Review System Administration Tasks:
            - Recap the commands and concepts related to system administration, including user and group management.
        2. Integration with Text Manipulation:
            - Example: 
                - Extract user information from the '/etc/passwd' file and display it in a readable format.
            - Example: 
                - Search for specific user accounts in the '/etc/passwd' file using grep and display relevant information.
        3. Practice Combined Tasks:
            - Example: 
                - Write a script that extracts user information and sends it to a text file for further analysis.
            - Example: 
                - Create a report summarizing user and group statistics, including counts and distributions.
        4. Reinforce Skills:
            - Exercise: 
                - Choose a system administration task, integrate it with text manipulation techniques, and practice until comfortable with the combined tasks.
