===============================================================================

- Advanced Text Manipulation Techniques
--------------------------------------
    - Text Manipulation Commands Overview:
--------------------------------------
        - cat: The 'cat' command is used to concatenate and display the contents of files.
        - less: The 'less' command is used to view text files with pagination, allowing scrolling through large files.
        - head: The 'head' command displays the beginning of a file or input.
        - tail: The 'tail' command displays the end of a file or input.
        - grep: The 'grep' command is used for searching text patterns within files.
        - wc: The 'wc' command counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.

    - Practice Filtering and Counting Text:
--------------------------------------
        1. Using cat:
            - Example: 
                - Display the contents of a file named 'example.txt':
                    cat example.txt
        2. Using less:
            - Example: 
                - View the contents of a large log file:
                    less large_log_file.txt
                - Navigate through the file using arrow keys and search for specific terms.
        3. Using head:
            - Example: 
                - Display the first 10 lines of a file named 'example.txt':
                    head example.txt
        4. Using tail:
            - Example: 
                - Display the last 10 lines of a file named 'example.txt':
                    tail example.txt
        5. Using grep:
            - Example: 
                - Search for lines containing the word 'error' in a file named 'log.txt':
                    grep 'error' log.txt
        6. Using wc:
            - Example: 
                - Count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file named 'example.txt':
                    wc example.txt
        7. Practice combining commands:
            - Exercise: 
                - Use grep to filter lines containing a specific pattern, then use wc to count the occurrences.
